The black scholes financial model is vital in allowing for better trades.
This program utilises the black scholes financial model to make better trades.

The user must create an account, then log into their account.
After this the user is able to select a stock in the top right as well as what option type they would like.
They can then enter their expiry and strike date, and simulate a stock to improve on their backtester ability.
